# MNIST MLP in PyTorch

This notebook loads the MNIST dataset, and creates, trains and evaluates a simple multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers (of size `128` and `64`) to classify the dataset. In 10 epochs, it achieves an accuracy of 97.76%.

Design choices are explained and several concepts explained in markdown cells in the notebook. 

I recommend viewing the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UVJfi_3h0Dk-SZlT5qkRvO_jk7qEaZwZ) to be able to see the `tqdm` progress bars.
